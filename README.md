# Web-Based Weather App
#### Video Demo: Not yet recorded
#### Description: 
For my cs50x final project, I have made a web-based weather app. Through this project, I have learnt to use API calls (by using the nominatim and open-meteo APIs), as well as solidifying my understanding of Flask. The application has a few basic features:

* Register/Login/Logout system
* Search system (takes location name and geolocates into coordinates for the weather API)
* Bookmark system (save the coordinates of your favourite places for faster access and no API calls)
* Random function (generates random coordinates until it finds a valid location). It is a feature made purely for fun.

##### Files
There are a few files in this project:

* app.py: This covers the main logic of all pages in the app.
